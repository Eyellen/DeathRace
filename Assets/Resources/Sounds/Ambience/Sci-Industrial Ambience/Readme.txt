Thanks for purchasing the Sci-Industrial Ambience Pack!



Within, you'll find two main folders: WAV, and OGG.

The sounds in both folders are identical, but in most cases, you'll want to use OGG. It's a compressed audio format that sounds great, and also cuts down a lot on the file size. (You can freely delete the WAV folder if you don't want the large, uncompressed files, of course!)

However, if you need the uncompressed WAV files, they have been provided as well. Feel free to edit them however you see fit.



There are three categories of ambient effects that are provided:

1: Full
	-These sounds were made to fill a whole space with multiple layers of sound. They'll liven up an environment with the least amount of work.

2: Elements
	-These sounds generally focus on only one type sound. They can be easily layered on top of each other to create your own environment ambience.

3: Musical
	-These are short tracks of eerie musical ambience that can quickly complement an atmosphere. Like all the other sounds, they loop as well.
	-Because they loop, some of them start off somewhat abruptly. To get the best effect, you may have to create an audio fade-in and fade-out script for it. Fortunately, a quick Google search will turn up many results that you can easily learn from.
