This is fan project made by Happiness Dream Team, our very first game.
Of course this project have issues. The reason that caused this issues was that we were learning of making games and we learned some important things when it was too late to rework it. One of the most big issues of the project is Client-Authoritative cars, in a good way it should've been made Server-Authoritative and have Client Prediction and Server Reconsiliation. We have got good knowledge from this project so now we know more important things and better ways to make games.
