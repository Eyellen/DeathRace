# Summary
This is fan project made by Happiness Dream Team in 3 month, our very first game.
This is multiplayer racing game with shooter elements. It is base on movie "Death Race".
The game has only 2 game modes: Race mode and Free mode.
In Free mode you're free to do whatever you want.
In Race you have to make laps and come to finish first or destroy all your opponents to win.

# From Developers
This is our first game and of course this project has issues. The reason that caused this issues was that we were learning of making games and we learned some important things when it was too late to rework it. One of the most big issues of the project is Client-Authoritative cars, in a good way it should've been made Server-Authoritative and have Client Prediction and Server Reconciliation. We have got good knowledge from this project so now we know more important things and better ways to make games.
